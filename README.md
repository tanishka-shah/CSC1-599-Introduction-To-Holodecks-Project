# CSC1-599-Introduction-To-Holodecks-Project

Objectives:

1. To implement a zoning strategy (for example, by using clustering to identify which dispatcher will dispatch the FLS for which points in the point cloud. Use of ML, DL techniques to further generate clusters)  that can minimize the flight distance and compare them with the algorithms implemented in the paper: Ghandeharizadeh, Shahram. "Display of 3D Illuminations using Flying Light Specks." arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.08346 (2022). 

2. After shortlisting a couple of candidate algorithms that minimize distance, fine tuning the algorithm by setting up thresholds for other parameters like rendition time, latency time and collision avoidance to come up with the most optimum algorithm. 

3. Simulating the proposed algorithm to get a clear understanding and applicative value of this algorithm.
